Next:
	- randomization (randomize a resource, a farmyard square)
		- get a farm board photo. Can I draw on top of a drawable in a specific spot?
		- get icons for all of the resources
		- get a dice icon instead of the question mark for Randomization
	- add an option to pre-populate players based on last game
	- set different colour of checkbox "border"
	- settings first checkbox, when you click it a blue background flashes which is outside of the black border. Put it inside the black border.
	- a couple places where resources are linked to enums by virtue of positioning, see if this can't be fixed
		- // TODO: relies on order of resources
	- make an error message if you try to search with no players selected
	- game type spinner isn't as wide as I would have preferred
		- need to modify the 9-patch files to remove left and right padding
	- apparently inflate should take a ViewGroup parent as second parameter
		- http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/
	- check to see how it looks on Nexus 7 (10% of installs)
		- maybe grab a few screenshots for it
	- use a "spinner drop down icon" on game history, instead of long-press. Long-press is now used for selection, which I'm not doing in the history.
		- could also put the "action buttons" for this inside the drop-down when you short-press
	- can I shrink the Create Game title to get more actions on the action bar?
	- Finish button for All Creatures is over top of scoring buttons when put into landscape mode
	
	
    - sending a single game or all game data to another android device
    - If you try to add 12 players on an HTC Desire X, you cannot scroll down to the buttons, just to the last added name
    - If you toggle between unlimited and limited players while having more than 5 players in the game (in the adding state) 
    	the (non-)appearance of the "add" Button is unpredicted. You have to remove a player first to make the Button appear correctly.
	


Future:

	- game count doesn't update right away if you don't close the app and restart it
	- make segmented control and number picker use XML for heights and text edit padding
	- chart icon is a little brighter than it should be
	- set the action bar to have a "back" button on it in some situations.
	- add down arrow back to spinner on SearchStatisticsActivity
	- could make FarmersScore to store Farmers only things
	- Requested: search by date defaults: end date is today, start date is start of this month (or something similar)
	- Create Game Screen doesn't update game count after playing (needs to update internal Player game count after saving)
	- Maybe have a dropdown to select game...and then a Settings table to store which was last selected.
	- UI to select who won in the case of a tie
	- "Share" game results?

	
Pipe dream:
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour (maybe just accept this...)
